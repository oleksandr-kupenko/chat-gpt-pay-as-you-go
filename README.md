At the moment it does not have a backend. Data is saved in local storage.

## Description
Custom UI for Chat GPT API with additional features. Created for practice with @ngrx/entity, but it turned out to be not completely useless.    

## Functional
- Ability to add and use various models from  [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo)
- Ability to edit previous messages (allows you to "cheat Chat GPT")
- Token counting for individual messages and total (allows you to observe how the cost of money depends on the complexity of the question)
- Saving data in the browser
